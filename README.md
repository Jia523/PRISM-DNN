PIST-DNN: A Two-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Pixel-wise Aerosol Inversion
This tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on how to use PIST-DNN, a two-stage deep learning framework designed for satellite-based aerosol retrieval. The framework includes:
* Pretraining using pixel-wise data without ground truth
* Finetuning using data with real station observations
All input datasets are allowed to contain missing values (NaN). The code is structured to handle this seamlessly.
